## Getting started

This project will test your skill & knowledge on everything you've learned so far. It includes `React`, `Node` and `MongoDB`.

The application has the following structure:

`client`  
Folder for everything front-end related. Houses the React application.

`client/src/App.jsx`  
Application entrypoint with `react-router` definitions.

`client/src/api`  
One file per resource (e.g. module, path, user) that has `XHR`/`fetch` functions for retreiving and manipulating data from the API.

`client/src/assets/css`  
All of your styles, the methodology/flavouring/preprocessor you use, is all up to you.

`client/src/assets/images`  

`client/src/components`  
All of your components, group these up per page.



`server`  
Folder for everything back-end related. Houses a decoupled, Node API

`server/src/controller`  
`server/src/model`  
`server/src/route`  
Each of these folders have one file per resource.
